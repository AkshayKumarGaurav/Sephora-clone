# Sephora (Clone)

Project-1: make a clone of https://sephora.nnnow.com/ site

This website is a clone of Sephora, where user can buy beauty based product. With efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till now in Unit-2 in Masai School, I was able to clone the front end with similar looks and features. A leader in luxury beauty and skincare, the purpose at Sephora online India is to create an inviting online beauty shopping experience and inspire fearlessness in our community.
